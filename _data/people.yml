- slug: david
  name: David Krueger
  title: Principal Investigator
  bio: David is an Assistant Professor at the University of Cambridge and a member of the Computational and Biological Learning lab (CBL). He is broadly interested in work (including in areas outside of ML, e.g. AI governance) that could reduce the risk of human extinction (“x-risk”) resulting from out-of-control AI systems.

- slug: bruno
  name: Bruno Mlodozeniec
  title: PhD Student
  bio: "Bruno's primary interest is in figuring out how deep learning models learn and represent the structure present in data, both in causal models or symmetries. He aims to create models that generalise robustly by learning adequate abstractions of the world they are embedded in, and reduce undesired reliance on spurious features."
